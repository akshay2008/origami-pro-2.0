Hi my name is Akshay Bajpai . As you can see this is my portfolio origami project .
I am in class 8th section B . My dream is to become a robotics engineer .
I am now going to make arduino based robots and also slowly do all my 
WhiteHat Junior projects as I promised to my mam.
Is this is too small ?
Don't worry , I will add more and more things gradually with time . 


Thank you.
